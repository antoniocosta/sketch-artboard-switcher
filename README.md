# Sketch Artboard Switcher

Simple sketch plugin to quickly switch / cycle between artboards while maintaining the current zoom level. Useful for editing across multiple artboards and for presenting. Think of it like next/previous tab in your browser.

- Switch to Previous Artboard: **cmd+shift+[**

- Switch to Next Artboard: **cmd+shift+]**

### Known Issues

- Works fine when artboards you switch between are of same height. When they are not (because each artboard is vertically centered when switched to) it might not have the quick preview and compare desired effect.

#### Notes

Based on **[Artboard-Tools](https://github.com/frankko/Artboard-Tools/)** by [@frankko](https://twitter.com/frankko) (from older version, trimmed down and zoom removed).

Other similar plugins:
- **[sketch-artboard](https://github.com/kenmoore/sketch-artboard)** by [@itskenmoore](https://twitter.com/itskenmoore) (zooms to the artboard's full width which was not desired.)
- **[select-next-artboard](https://github.com/vrjbndr/select-next-artboard)** by [@vrjbndr](https://twitter.com/vrjbndr) (not working anymore).
